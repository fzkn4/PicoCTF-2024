# FORMAT STRING 0
![format_string_0](https://github.com/fzkn4/PicoCTF-2024/assets/147215607/81b20148-f983-4372-b2fe-5bbf0fb2ec58)

This challenge is an introduction to `format string exploitation`. This is a kind of vulnerability that utilizes a format string function to achieve information leak, code execution, and DoS. 
#
> First, we'll run the program:
![format_string_0_pic1](https://github.com/fzkn4/PicoCTF-2024/assets/147215607/c098c1ea-11c2-423f-b9d2-2b5a01fbafe7)

Here, we are given 3 choices: `Breakf@st_Burger, Gr%114d_Cheese, Bac0n_D3luxe`

We can see that `Gr%114d_Cheese` contains `%114d` in which if we take a look at this table, `%d` is a format specifier for decimals.

#### So what is `%114d`? Let's try to understand `%114d`:
We know that `%d` is a format specifier, so what is `114`? Well, `114` is the field width. It's a non-negative decimal integer that specifies the minimum number of characters to be printed for the argument. If the argument has fewer characters, it's padded with `spaces (by default)` on the left to reach the specified width. Here, 114 sets the minimum width to 114 characters.

> Let's try and choose `Gr%114d_Cheese`: 
![format_string_0_pic2](https://github.com/fzkn4/PicoCTF-2024/assets/147215607/2f2eb814-4a09-42dc-a5a7-d2236beed0f0)

It prints random decimal numbers `4202954` padded with whitespaces.
#
Next, we will be given another 3 choices to choose from: `Pe%to_Portobello, $outhwest_Burger, Cla%sic_Che%s%steak`

This time, one of the choices, `Cla%sic_Che%s%steak` contains `%s` which we know, is a format specifier for string.
> Now let's see what happens if we choose `Cla%sic_Che%s%steak`:
![format_string_0_pic3](https://github.com/fzkn4/PicoCTF-2024/assets/147215607/5f9ad845-6f7a-4837-a144-a2c82f298644)

It gave us the flag.

Flag: `picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_f89c1405}`
